## Configuration
- Example configuration for a single domain with hosts (without email notification):
```
 record_ttl = '7207'
 domains_and_hosts = (
     ["namesilo.com", ["", "www", "mail"]],  # This will update namesilo.com, www.namesilo.com, and mail.namesilo.com.
 )
```
- Example configuration for multiple domains and hosts (without email notification):
```
 record_ttl = '7207'
 domains_and_hosts = (
     ["namesilo.com", ["www", "mail"]],  # This will update www.namesilo.com, and mail.namesilo.com.
     ["CNN.com", ["", "www"]],  # This will update CNN.com, and www.CNN.com.
     ["NPR.org", ["giving", "charity"]],  #  This will update giving.NPR.org, and charity.NPR.org.
     ["example.org", [""]]  #  This will update example.org.
 )
```
### Additional configuration lines for email using SendGrid.com
```
send_mail = True  # Either "True" or "False"
send_time = int(strftime('%I')) % 8 == 0  # Send an email at 8AM and 8PM.  Set to True to always send.
email_from_address = "someone@somedomain.tld"
email_from_name = "NameServer Systems"
email_to_addresses = ["jane.doe@company", "john.doe@company", "my.manager@somebusiness.com"]  # comma separated.
subject = "DNS update notification, timestamped: " + strftime('%x %H:%M:%S')  # Subject line.
```

# How To

1. Generate and save an API key from NameSilo. See [NameSilo](https://www.namesilo.com/Support/Account-Options) for help.
2. Generate and save an API key from SendGrid. See ...
3. Create copies of the script as needed and configure them.
4. Export required ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: NAMESILO_API_KEY and SENDGRID_API_KEY
5. Save the python file and run it using `python <whateverYouNamedIt>.py`.  Some systems may run two versions of python: `python3 <whateverYouNamedIt>.py`
6. (optional) Add this command to cron or scheduler depending, ya know?

You can also use this as a class in your own programs, though it is a rather immature implementation as of writing.
